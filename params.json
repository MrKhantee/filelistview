{"name":"Filelistview","tagline":"A list view that can be used to navigate the Android file system (with a few other views added) ","body":"### Android File ListView\r\nThis is a simple file browser meant to be integrated into Android apps.\r\n\r\n### Integrating this project\r\nIntegrating this project requires three steps:\r\n- Put the contents of the /src folder somewhere in your /src folder (and, if necessary, change the paths).\r\n- Take the image files from the /res folder, and put them in your own res folder \r\n- Take the strings from the values.xml file and add them to the end of your own values.xml file\r\n- Update the imports in this project as necessary (you will need to update the R import to fit your project).\r\n\r\n### Documentation (taken from README.md)\r\nFileListView:\r\n\r\nThis is a simple adaptation of the basic Android ListView to work as a file explorer. If you wish to heavily customise the UI of your file then this is probably what you should use. Currently, the view just offers a single onFileSelect listener, icons for directories/unrecognised files/.jpgs and .png files get a little icon from their own image.\r\n\r\nImportant Fields:\r\n\r\nsetExtensions(String[] extensions) - this method lets you limit the possible file extensions that can be selected. Default: Empty List (accepts all extensions)\r\n\r\nsetDirectoriesOnly(boolean enabled) - if this is set to true, then no files will be shown, only folders. Default: false\r\n\r\nsearchWith(String text) - when this is set, only files/folders containing the specified text are shown. Default: \"\" (accepts all files/folders)\r\n\r\nsetSortingMode(SortingMode mode) - this takes any of the available modes and sorts the list in the specified order. Default: Alphabetical\r\n\r\nrefresh() - this refreshes the list adapter after any one of the above fields is changed. In order to see the effects of the changes to the above files, you MUST call this method.\r\n\r\nsetFileSelectedListener(FileSelectedListener listener) - this is the listener for when a file is selected, but it should be noted that this listener only fires on file selection (i.e. NOT on folder selection)\r\n\r\nFileOpenView:\r\n\r\nThis is what I would recommend using if you want to select an already created file. It is a set of views that includes the FileListView, an EditText to enable searching through the files and a Button to enable the selection of whole folders.\r\n\r\nImportant Fields:\r\n\r\nsetSearchEnabled(boolean enabled) - this method lets you set whether a search bar will appear at that top of the view to let you search through the current selected directory. Default: true\r\n\r\nsetFolderSelectEnabled(boolean enabled) - when set to true, a button will appear next to the search bar to enable the selection of the current folder (which will fire the FileSelectedListener upon being pressed). Default: false\r\n\r\nsetFileSelectedListener(FileSelectedListener listener) - this is a listener for when a file is selected... see FileListView.setFileSelectedListener(..)\r\n\r\nFileSaveView:\r\n\r\nThis is what I recommend using as a view if you want to save (a potentially new file) to the file system. Although it extends FileOpenView, not all of the methods are implemented, as some are not relevant. Those irrelevant methods throw exceptions when called\r\n\r\nImportant Fields:\r\n\r\nenableOverwriteWarning(boolean enabled) - when set to true, a warning dialog will be displayed before the selection listener is fired to make sure the user knows they are replacing a file. When false, this dialog will not be shown. Default: true\r\n\r\nsetFileSelectedListener(FileSelectedListener listener) - this is fired when the Save File button is pressed, and sends the name typed into the EditText and the base directory back as a single file.\r\n\r\nsetSearchEnabled(boolean enabled) - throws a NoSuchMethodException -- do not use\r\n\r\nsetFolderSelectEnabled(boolean enabled - throws a NoSuchMethodException -- do not use\r\n\r\nUsage Examples: To use this project, you must add the resources in the res/ folder of this project to your own /res folder. This will enable this project to use the resources it needs. Example use (in a dialog):\r\n\r\n    AlertDialog.Builder b = new AlertDialog.Builder(getContext());\r\n    b.setNegativeButton(\"cancel\", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\r\n        public void onClick(DialogInterface d) {}\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    FileListView fileListView = new FileListView(getContext());\r\n    fileListView.setExtensions(new String[] { \"jpg, png, jpeg\" });\r\n    b.setView(fileListView);\r\n    final AlertDialog d = b.show();\r\n\r\n    fileListView.setFileSelectedListener(new FileListView.FileSelectedListener() {\r\n        onSelected(File selected) {\r\n            //do something with the file\r\n            d.dismiss();\r\n         }\r\n    });\r\n### Contributing\r\nI will gladly accept any pull requests that add/fix anything.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJackson Woodruff (@j-c-w)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNot working right?
